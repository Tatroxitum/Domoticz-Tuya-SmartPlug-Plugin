# Domoticz-Tuya-SmartPlug-Plugin

A Domoticz plugin to manage Tuya Smart Plug (single and multi socket device)
This is a modified plugin from the modified plugin by sincze, The sincze plugin used a script called by cron and the plugin just created the devices.
Now all is managed by the plugin and using the tinytuya API.

Multi socket has not been tested. I only have 1 socket. Keep in mind I am not a Python developer, pertinent remarks are appreciated. 
Plugin is provided on best-effort.

## ONLY TESTED FOR Raspberry Pi

With Python version 3.7.3 & Domoticz version V2022.1
& Domoticz version V2025.2 with built in python and Debian 13

## Prerequisites

This plugin is based on the tinytuya Python library. For the installation of this library,
follow the Installation guide below.
See [`https://github.com/jasonacox/tinytuya] for more information.

## Installation

Assuming that domoticz directory is installed in your home directory.

```bash
cd ~/domoticz/plugins
git clone https://github.com/Tatroxitum/Domoticz-Tuya-SmartPlug-Plugin
cd Domoticz-Tuya-SmartPlug-Plugin
python -m tinytuya scan #see under for devID & local key extraction
# restart domoticz:
sudo /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh restart
```
## Known issues

If the watt values are very low (for example 3W) there is an issue in Domoticz and the values in kwh are not calculated
https://github.com/domoticz/domoticz/issues/5326


## Updating

Like other plugins, in the Domoticz-Tuya-SmartPlug-Plugin directory:
```bash
git pull
sudo /etc/init.d/domoticz.sh restart
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **IP address** | IP of the Smart Plug eg. 192.168.1.231 |
| **DevID** | devID of the Smart Plug |
| **Local Key** | Local Key of the Smart Plug |
| **TinyTuya Version** | Local TinyTuya version of the Smart Plug |
| **DPS** |	1 for single socket device and a list of dps separated by ';' for multisocket device eg. 1;2;3;7 #not tested
| **DPS group** | None for single socket device and a list of list of dps separated by ':' for multisocket device eg. 1;2 : 3;7 #not tested
| **ID Amp;Watt;Volt** | Enter the ID's of these specific devices separated by ; eg 18;19;20 (nt tested with Multisocket)
| **Debug** | default is 0 |

**DPS** should only includes values that correspond to plug's dps id. Be careful some devices also have timers in the dps state.

**DPS group** can be used to group multiple sockets in one Domoticz switch.

Helper scripts get_dps.py turnON.py and turnOFF.py can help:
* to determine the dps list
* to check that the needed information are valid (i.e. devID and Local Key) before using the plugin.

## DevID & Local Key Extraction

Recommanded method:
Linking a Tuya device with Smart Link & get local kew with this MMI:
[`https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md#linking-a-tuya-device-with-smart-link]

TinyTuya has a built in network scanner that can be used to find Tuya Devices on your local network. It will show Address, Device ID and Version for each device.
python -m tinytuya scan

## Udpate from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0
To update from 2.0.1 to 2.1.0, do the following steps as some parameters have switched values: 
- Deactivate the Tuya-SmartPlug-Plugin hardware in Domoticz
- Note all the parameters
- git pull
- Restart domoticz 
- Put all the parameters in the Tuya-SmartPlug-Plugin hardware in Domoticz
- Activate the Tuya-SmartPlug-Plugin hardware in Domoticz
